# flask

## Setting Up Flask: 
We start by installing Flask and creating a simple Python file. This is where our web app will live.

## Creating Routes: 
We define routes in Flask. A route is basically a URL that users can visit, and it tells Flask what to do when that URL is accessed. For example, when someone goes to your websiteâ€™s homepage, Flask will display the appropriate content.

## Rendering Templates: 
Flask helps us create dynamic web pages through HTML templates. We use a special folder for these templates, and Flask allows us to insert dynamic data into them. This means when a user requests, for example, a login page, Flask automatically fills in any necessary data.

## Handling Forms: 
We can create web forms for user input, like registration or contact forms. Flask provides tools to process this data easily, making it possible to get information from users and respond back.

## Connecting to Databases: 
In this course, we also learn how to connect our Flask application to a database, allowing us to store and retrieve data as needed for our app.

## Running the App: 
Finally, we run our Flask app on a local server to see our web application in action. This step is crucial to test our code and make sure everything works as expected.
